# Coding Quiz
## Description

As part of our fourth weekly challenge, we were asked to use what we learned about Web APIs to create a timed coding quiz. We were tasked with applying our knowledge of event listeners, timer functions, and traversal of the document object to ensure the quiz was interactive.


As part of this assignment, I applied my newly-learned skills in the following:

- JavaScript event listeners
- JavaScript setInterval() function
- JavaScript string methods
- JavaScript getAttribute() function
- DOM traversal using JavaScript
- General knowledge of the window object and other Web APIs

## Credits
